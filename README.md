# Observation 1
Based on the Capomulin Scatterplot, it's clear that the heavier the mouse is, the larger the tumor will be at the end of treatment. This is reinforced by the correlation coefficient, which is .84. a correlation coefficient between 0 and 1 demonstrates a positive relationship between the two variables (meaning, as one variable increases, so will the other).

# Observation 2
Based on the line plot for Mouse Id #s185, Capomulin must be taken over time for it to be effective. As seen from the data, the tumor shrunk the most between timepoints 5 and 10, as well as time points 30 and 45.

# Observation 3
Based on the boxplot, Capomulin and Ramicane are the more effective drug at reducing the size of squamous cell carcinomas, while Infubinol and Ceftamin weren't.
